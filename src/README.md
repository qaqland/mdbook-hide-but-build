# Introduction

Build all markdown files in src but only SUMMARY.md showed in sidebar.

See GitHub repository's example for details:

- config in `book.toml`
- copy script `hide-but-build.py`

## How we do this

Chapter with empty title and number will be hidden in sidebar.

It is not a good idea but maybe useful.

## One more thing

- Auto generate title for markdown files
- Auto generate ALLPAGES.md and append it to SUMMARY.md

more features in the future?

- edit time and last edit author for each page
- last edit/update pages for this book/wiki
